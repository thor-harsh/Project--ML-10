**In this project we will build the model Support Vector Machines for classifying Purchased as 0(Not Purchased) or 1(Purchased) from different features in the dataset**.<br></br>  

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for linear or nonlinear classification, regression, and even outlier detection tasks. 
Kernel Function is a method used to take data as input and transform it into the required form of processing data.
“Kernel” is used due to a set of mathematical functions used in Support Vector Machine providing the window to manipulate the data.<br>
So, Kernel Function generally transforms the training set of data so that a non-linear decision surface is able to transform to a linear equation in a higher number of dimension spaces. Basically, It returns the inner product between two points in a standard feature dimension. 

**Important- Note: Explore the dataset once before going through the code.**

**So what are you waiting for...? Jump to the code to get started. As usual for any doubt or query see you in pull request section 😁😂. Thanks!**
